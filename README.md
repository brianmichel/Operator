# ðŸŽ› Operator

Operator will be an application for OP-1 and OP-Z devices that lets you easily back up, restore, and load samples onto your device on the go.

Right now it's mostly a test harness for analyzing aif files.

# Getting up and Running

1. Clone this repo
2. Install ruby dependencies using `bundle install`
3. Install CocoaPods using `bundle exec pod install`

## Why don't you check in the pods directory?

Mostly because of the size of the binaries used in the AudioKit pod exceed the file size limit allowed by GitHub.
